### Force Fields: What exactly are they?
A force field in an MD Simulation software defines the characteristic potential energy of conventional/unconventional atoms and their bonds via equations and paramters which it stores in text files(`.dat` for parameters, `.frcmod` for modified parameters and `.lib` for topology template). In doing so, the force on each atom can be calculated by the gradient(in the direction of maximum change) of the potential energy. 
A Force Field therefore refers to the functional form and the parameter sets used to calculate the potential energy of a system on an atomistic level.
Some usual components of the force fields are as follows:
#### Bond Stretching
#### Angle 
#### Torsional Rotation
#### Non-bonded Interactions
